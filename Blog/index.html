            <p>Do you remember those little toys that would try to guess what you were thinking?
                They were very popular when I was a little kid. It was just a little plastic ball with one
                screen to display text. There were a few buttons, but the most important was the Yes and the No button(if only life were that simple).
            </p>
            <p>This toy fascinated me. I began to wonder how it worked, how did it always seem to guess what I was
                thinking?  Even trying to trick it wouldn't work.</p>
            <p>Well, while trying to plan this little website, I felt myself asking myself 20 questions: Who am I? What
                do I do?  What do I want to say? Why do I need to say it this way?
            </p>
            <p>To answer some of those questions: I am a Software Engineering student (not a very good one) and I am working towards
                a Bachelors degree.  I wanted to make a blog to keep a record of what I learn in the off-chance that it might help
                someone else in their journey.  
            </p>
            <p>I am sure this website is going to grow and change as I get better at programming and as I learn more.  I hope you stick around for the journey!</p>
